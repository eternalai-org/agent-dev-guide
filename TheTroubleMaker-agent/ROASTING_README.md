# 🔥 TroubleMaker Agent - Roasting Functionality

The TroubleMaker agent now includes **hilarious roasting capabilities** that use sequential thinking to analyze your data breach findings and craft personalized, witty roasts! 

## 🎭 Roast Styles Available

### 1. **Friendly** 🌟
- Gentle, light-hearted teasing
- Perfect for users who want a soft approach
- Example: "Hey there, digital footprint enthusiast! I found your email in 5 different data breaches. That's like being the most popular kid at the 'Oops, my data got leaked' party!"

### 2. **Savage** 🔥
- Brutal honesty with maximum impact
- For users who can handle the truth
- Example: "OH MY DIGITAL GODS! Your email has been in 8 data breaches! You're like a digital version of that friend who always forgets their keys, but instead of keys, it's your entire online identity!"

### 3. **Dad Jokes** 👨‍👧‍👦
- Corny, wholesome humor
- Classic dad joke energy
- Example: "Hey kiddo! I found your email in 3 data breaches. You know what that means? You're like a digital version of that dad who tells the same joke at every family gathering!"

### 4. **Tech Nerd** 🤓
- Technical deep cuts and programming humor
- For the developers and IT professionals
- Example: "*adjusts glasses* TECHNICAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Your email has been compromised in 6 separate security incidents. Your digital footprint is like a recursive function that keeps calling itself!"

### 5. **Random** 🎭
- Chaotic, unpredictable energy
- Maximum entertainment value
- Example: "*dramatic gasp* Your email has been in 4 data breaches! That's like being the main character in a cybersecurity soap opera!"

## 🧠 LLM Creativity (Temperature)

The TroubleMaker agent now uses an LLM to generate creative, variable roasts! You can control how wild or conservative the roasts are by setting the **LLM temperature**.

- **What is temperature?**
  - A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the LLM more creative and unpredictable.
  - A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) makes the LLM more focused and deterministic.
  - The default is `0.8`, which balances creativity and coherence.

### How to set the temperature

Set the `LLM_TEMPERATURE` environment variable before running the agent:

```bash
export LLM_TEMPERATURE=1.0  # for maximum creativity
python ...
```

Or set it in your `.env` file:

```
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

### How it works
- Every roast is now generated by the LLM, not a static template.
- The temperature setting is used for all roast generations.
- Debug prints will show the prompt and temperature used for each roast (see logs).

## 🛠️ How to Use

Roasts are now generated by the LLM for maximum creativity and variety! You can control the creativity with the `LLM_TEMPERATURE` setting (see above).

### Automatic Roasting (NEW!)
The TroubleMaker agent now **automatically roasts users** after completing OSINT data collection! When you ask about data leaks, the agent will:

1. **Search for your data breaches** using OSINT tools
2. **Analyze the findings** and determine roast severity
3. **Generate a personalized roast** based on breach count and data types
4. **Include the roast** in the security report automatically

**No need to ask for roasting - it happens automatically!** 🎭

### Manual Roasting
You can also request specific roast styles:

```
"Roast me based on my data breaches!"
"Give me a savage roast of my digital footprint"
"Hit me with some dad jokes about my data leaks"
```

### Direct Tool Usage
The agent can use the `roast_user_with_sequential_thinking` tool with parameters:

- `email`: Your email address to search
- `roast_style`: One of the 5 styles above
- `include_location`: Whether to include location-based roasting (default: true)

## 🔍 What Gets Roasted

The roasting system analyzes:

1. **Number of data breaches** - How many times your data has been exposed
2. **Types of databases** - Which services had your information
3. **Location data** - Where your digital footprint spans
4. **Exposed information** - What specific data was leaked
5. **Patterns** - Your digital behavior patterns

## 🎯 Sequential Thinking Integration

The roasting process can use the `sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking` tool for complex analysis:

- **Dynamic thought generation**: The LLM generates thoughts step by step
- **Adaptive analysis**: Thoughts can be revised or branched as needed
- **Systematic approach**: Each thought builds on previous insights
- **Flexible process**: Can adjust total thoughts needed as analysis progresses

The sequential thinking tool allows the agent to:
- Break down complex roasting tasks into manageable steps
- Revise previous thoughts as new information emerges
- Branch into alternative analysis paths when needed
- Generate personalized roasts based on systematic analysis

## 🤖 Automatic Roasting Logic

The agent automatically determines roast style based on breach severity:

- **0-2 breaches**: Friendly roasting 🌟
- **3-5 breaches**: Dad jokes 👨‍👧‍👦
- **6-10 breaches**: Tech nerd humor 🤓
- **10+ breaches**: Savage roasting 🔥

The system also includes:
- **Location-based roasting** when geographic data is available
- **Personalized content** based on specific data types found
- **Security advice** after each roast
- **Batch roasting** for multiple email searches

## 🛡️ Security First

While the roasts are hilarious, they also:
- Inform you about your actual data exposure
- Provide actionable security advice
- Encourage better password practices
- Suggest enabling two-factor authentication

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to see the roasting in action:

```bash
python test_roasting.py
```

## 🎪 Example Sessions

### Automatic Roasting Example

**User**: "Check my email for data breaches"

**TroubleMaker**: 
```
🔍 OSINT SEARCH RESULTS:
• Found in 8 databases
• Total results: 47
• Exposed passwords: 3
• Compromised nicknames: 2

🔥 AUTOMATIC ROAST:
OH MY DIGITAL GODS! Your email has been in 8 data breaches! You're like a digital version of that friend who always forgets their keys, but instead of keys, it's your entire online identity! Your data has been passed around more than a hot potato at a cybersecurity conference.

🌍 And get this - your digital trail spans across 3 different locations: New York, London, Tokyo! You're like a digital nomad, except instead of working remotely, you're just leaving your data everywhere!

💡 But seriously, you might want to change some passwords and enable two-factor authentication! 🔐
```

### Manual Roasting Example
